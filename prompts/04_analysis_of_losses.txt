Using the `games_df` DataFrame, I need to analyze the team's performance specifically in the games they lost. Please perform the following steps:
1.  Establish the baseline season averages: "Goals Scored per game" (12.37) and "Goals Against per game" (11.63).
2.  Filter the DataFrame to include ONLY the games the team lost.
3.  Calculate the average goals scored and average goals against in those losses.
4.  Present a summary table comparing the Season Average vs. the Average in Losses, and calculate the "Performance Gap" for both offense and defense.
